GA02: Multi-Document Hybrid RAG Search Engine
**Overview**

GA02: Multi-Document Hybrid RAG Search Engine is an end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to intelligently search, retrieve, and generate answers from multiple documents.
It combines semantic vector search + keyword-based retrieval to deliver highly relevant and accurate responses, making it suitable for real-world enterprise and research use cases.

This project demonstrates strong skills in LLMs, NLP, embeddings, vector databases, and scalable AI system design.
